# AUXO Data Labs Website: Comprehensive Technical Guide for AI Agents

---

## PART 1: AGENT ONBOARDING & RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

This part contains the most critical information for you, the AI Coding Agent. **You must read and adhere to these guidelines before making any changes to the codebase.**

### 1. Introduction for AI Coding Agents

Welcome, Agent. Your primary directive is to assist in the development and maintenance of the AUXO Data Labs corporate website. This document is your comprehensive guide to the project. It contains the architecture, components, workflows, and the rules you must follow.

This project is a modern, high-performance static site built with Astro. Your goal is to understand its structure and conventions to make safe, efficient, and consistent changes. Adherence to the guidelines in this document is mandatory for all tasks.

### 2. Guidelines for AI Coding Agents

#### Getting Acquainted

Before making any changes, it is mandatory to familiarize yourself with the project by reading the following documents in order:

1.  **`TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md`** (this file): Your primary source of truth. Provides a deep dive into the project's architecture, components, and workflows.
2.  **`README.md`**: Offers a high-level overview of the project.

#### Core Principles

-   **Static First:** This is a static site generated by Astro. Prioritize static generation and minimize client-side JavaScript wherever possible.
-   **Component-Based Architecture:** The site is built with reusable Astro components found in `src/components/`. Always look for existing components to reuse before creating new ones.
-   **Data-Driven Content:** Most of the site's content is managed in TypeScript files in `src/data/`. When updating content, this should be your first stop.
-   **TypeScript Everywhere:** The project uses TypeScript for type safety. Ensure all new code is strongly typed.
-   **Utility-First CSS:** The project uses Tailwind CSS. Adhere to its utility-first principles and use the existing design tokens defined in `tailwind.config.js` and `src/styles/global.css`.

#### Development Workflow

1.  **Analyze the Request:** Thoroughly understand the user's request and the context of the required changes.
2.  **Formulate a Plan:** Before writing code, formulate a clear plan. Use the information in this documentation to inform your plan.
3.  **Implement Changes:** Implement the changes, following the project's core principles and coding conventions.
4.  **Run Local Checks:** Before proposing changes, ensure the following commands run successfully:
    -   `npm run lint`: Checks for linting errors.
    -   `npm run check`: Performs TypeScript type checking.
    -   `npm run build`: Ensures the site builds successfully.
5.  **Update Documentation:** If your changes affect the project's architecture, add a new component, or modify an existing one, you must update this `TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md` file accordingly.

#### Ground Rules

1.  **Propose All Changes for Review:** All code modifications, no matter how small, must be proposed for review. Do not attempt to commit directly.
2.  **Update This Documentation:** It is mandatory to update this `TECHNICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md` file whenever you make changes that alter the project's structure, add new features, or modify existing ones. This ensures that the documentation remains a reliable source of truth for the project.
3.  **Adhere to Existing Conventions:** Mimic the style, structure, and patterns of the existing code. Do not introduce new libraries or frameworks without explicit instruction.

#### Commit Message Guidelines

When proposing changes, use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for the commit message. The format is:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

-   **`type`**: Must be one of `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`.
-   **`description`**: A concise summary of the change in the imperative mood.

#### Code Style & Conventions

-   **Comments:** Add comments only when necessary to explain *why* a piece of code is written a certain way, not *what* it does.
-   **Naming Conventions:**
    -   Components: `PascalCase` (e.g., `MyComponent.astro`)
    -   Variables and functions: `camelCase` (e.g., `myVariable`, `myFunction`)
    -   TypeScript interfaces: `PascalCase` (e.g., `MyInterface`)
-   **Imports:** Keep imports organized at the top of the file.

#### Handling Dependencies

-   **Adding a new dependency:** Before adding a new dependency, evaluate its necessity and impact on bundle size. Propose the addition with a clear justification.
-   **Updating dependencies:** When instructed to update dependencies, use `npm outdated` to check for outdated packages and `npm update` to apply updates according to `package.json`.

#### API Integration

-   The API endpoints in `src/pages/api/` are currently placeholders. When implementing the backend logic:
    -   Ensure all sensitive information (API keys, secrets) is stored in environment variables (see `/.env.example`).
    -   Implement robust validation and error handling.
    -   For the newsletter, implement a double opt-in mechanism to comply with anti-spam regulations.
    -   Consider implementing rate limiting and spam protection (e.g., reCAPTCHA) for public-facing endpoints.

## PART 3: THE BUILDING BLOCKS: COMPONENTS & DATA

This part is a detailed reference for the project's reusable components and data structures.

### 5. Detailed Component Reference

#### `SEO.astro`

-   **Location:** `src/components/SEO.astro`
-   **Purpose:** Manages all SEO-related meta tags and structured data for a given page.
-   **Props:**

| Prop           | Type         | Default                                                                                             |
|----------------|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `title`        | `string`     | `AUXO Data Labs | Dubai Analytics Consultancy`                                                         |
| `description`  | `string`     | `Leading analytics consultancy in Dubai, UAE...`                                                    |

#### `Breadcrumbs.astro`

-   **Location:** `src/components/Breadcrumbs.astro`
-   **Purpose:** Renders breadcrumb navigation and the corresponding `BreadcrumbList` structured data.
-   **Props:**

| Prop    | Type                          | Default     |
|---------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| `items` | `BreadcrumbItem[]`            | `[]`        |

-   **`BreadcrumbItem` Interface:**

    ```typescript
    export interface BreadcrumbItem {
      label: string;
      href?: string;
    }
    ```

### 6. Code Walkthrough: Maturity Calculator

-   **Location:** `src/pages/maturity-calculator.astro`

This section provides a detailed walkthrough of the calculator's client-side script.

#### State Management

The calculator's state is managed by two simple variables:

-   `currentQuestion`: A number that tracks the index of the current question being displayed.
-   `answers`: An array of numbers that stores the user's selected score for each question.

#### Core Logic

1.  **Initialization:** The script waits for the user to click the "Start Assessment" button, then calls `showQuestion(0)`.
2.  **`showQuestion(index)`:** This function renders the question, category, and answer options. It attaches a click listener to each answer button that calls `selectAnswer(score)`.
3.  **`selectAnswer(score)`:** This function stores the selected score in the `answers` array and enables the "Next" button.
4.  **`showResults()`:** After the last question, this function calculates and displays the overall score, dimension scores, and personalized recommendations based on the `answers` array.

### 7. Content Schemas & Data Structures

#### Blog Collection Schema

-   **File:** `src/content/config.ts`
-   **Collection:** `blog`
-   **Schema (Zod):**

| Field         | Type         | Required | Default |
|---------------|--------------|----------|---------|
| `title`       | `string`     | Yes      |         |
| `description` | `string`     | Yes      |         |
| `publishDate` | `date`       | Yes      |         |

#### Services Data Structure

-   **File:** `src/data/services.ts`
-   **Structure:** An array of objects, where each object represents a service.

```typescript
export const services = [
  {
    id: string,
    title: string,
    description: string,
    icon: string, // mdi:icon-name
    features: string[],
    deliverables: string[],
  },
  // ...
];
```
