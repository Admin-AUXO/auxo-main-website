### Why This Happens:
1. **New Domain**: Site not fully indexed yet
2. **No Sitelinks**: Google hasn't determined which pages are important
3. **Weak Internal Linking**: Google can't tell which pages matter most
4. **Missing/Weak Page Titles**: Pages don't clearly describe themselves

### Solutions:

#### CRITICAL - Fix Page Titles (30 minutes)

**Current State Analysis Needed**:
Let me check your current page titles...

**Action**: Update ALL page titles to include brand and be search-friendly

**Format**: `Primary Keyword - Secondary Info | AUXO Data Labs`

```
AUXO Data Labs
auxodata.com
Data analytics consultancy in Dubai, UAE...

Services          Calculator        About Us
Predictive Analytics    Business Intelligence    Contact
```

### How to Achieve This:

#### A. Optimize Important Pages

**For Services Page** (`/services`):

1. **Title**: `Data Analytics Services | AUXO Data Labs`
2. **Meta Description**: `Explore our data analytics services: Predictive Analytics, Business Intelligence, Data Engineering, ML & AI Solutions, Data Governance, and Cloud Analytics.`
3. **H1**: `Our Data Analytics Services`
4. **Content**:
   - Clear list of all 6 services at top
   - Link to each service detail page
   - Brief description of each

**For Calculator Page** (`/maturity-calculator`):

1. **Title**: `Free Data Maturity Assessment Calculator | AUXO Data Labs`
2. **Meta Description**: `Assess your organization's data maturity level with our free interactive calculator. Get personalized insights and recommendations in minutes.`
3. **H1**: `Data Maturity Assessment Calculator`
4. **Add Keywords**: "free", "assessment", "tool", "evaluation"

**For Each Service Detail Page**:

1. **Title Format**: `[Service Name] Services | AUXO Data Labs`
2. **Meta Description**: `[Service name] services in Dubai. [Key benefit]. [What we do]. Contact AUXO Data Labs today.`
3. **H1**: Match the service name exactly
4. **Content**:
   - What is it (definition)
   - Benefits
   - Our approach
   - Call to action

#### B. Add FAQ Schema to Important Pages

**Why**: FAQ rich results stand out in search

**Where to Add**:
- Services page: "What services do you offer?"
- Calculator page: "What is a data maturity assessment?"
- Each service page: FAQs about that service

**Implementation**:
```json
{
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [{
    "@type": "Question",
    "name": "What is data maturity assessment?",
    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "A data maturity assessment evaluates..."
    }
  }]
}
```

#### C. Improve Meta Descriptions

**Current Issue**: Likely missing or generic meta descriptions

**Action**: Write compelling meta descriptions for all pages

**Rules**:
- 150-160 characters
- Include main keyword
- Include brand name
- Include call to action or benefit
- Be specific and compelling

**Examples**:
```
Services: "Expert data analytics services in Dubai: Predictive Analytics, BI, ML/AI, Data Engineering. Transform your data into insights. Contact AUXO Data Labs."
