- ‚úÖ Free for up to 100 emails/day (plenty for a contact form)

---

## üìã Step-by-Step Setup

### **Phase 1: SendGrid Account Setup (15 minutes)**

#### Step 1: Create SendGrid Account
1. Go to https://signup.sendgrid.com/
2. Sign up using your Google Workspace email (`yourname@auxodata.ae`)
3. Verify your email address
4. Choose the **Free plan** (100 emails/day forever)

#### Step 2: Domain Authentication (IMPORTANT!)

This step is crucial for deliverability (avoiding spam folder).

1. In SendGrid dashboard, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Sender Authentication**
2. Click **"Authenticate Your Domain"**
3. Follow the wizard:
   - Select your DNS provider (probably Google Domains or your domain registrar)
   - Enter your domain: `auxodata.ae`
   - Click "Next"

4. SendGrid will provide you with DNS records like this:

```
Type: CNAME
Host: s1._domainkey
Value: s1.domainkey.u12345678.wl123.sendgrid.net

Type: CNAME
Host: s2._domainkey
Value: s2.domainkey.u12345678.wl123.sendgrid.net

Type: CNAME
Host: em1234
Value: u12345678.wl123.sendgrid.net
```

#### Step 3: Add DNS Records to Google Workspace

**Option A: If you manage DNS in Google Domains**
1. Go to https://domains.google.com
2. Select `auxodata.ae`
3. Go to **DNS** tab
4. Click **Manage custom records**
5. Add each CNAME record provided by SendGrid
6. Wait 24-48 hours (usually propagates in 1-2 hours)

**Option B: If you manage DNS elsewhere**
1. Log into your domain registrar (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)
2. Find DNS management
3. Add the CNAME records provided by SendGrid
4. Wait for DNS propagation

#### Step 4: Verify Domain in SendGrid

1. After adding DNS records, wait a few hours
2. Go back to SendGrid ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Sender Authentication**
3. Click **Verify** next to your domain
4. If successful, you'll see a green checkmark ‚úÖ

#### Step 5: Create API Key

1. In SendGrid, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API Keys**
2. Click **"Create API Key"**
3. Settings:
   - **API Key Name**: `AUXO Website Contact Form`
   - **API Key Permissions**: Choose "Restricted Access"
   - Enable **only**: "Mail Send" ‚Üí Full Access
4. Click **"Create & View"**
5. **COPY THE API KEY NOW** (you'll only see it once!)

It will look like: `SG.xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`

---

### **Phase 2: Configure Your Website (10 minutes)**

#### Step 1: Create Environment File

1. In your website folder, create a file named `.env`
2. Add these lines (replace with your actual values):

```bash
# SendGrid Configuration
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your-actual-api-key-here
SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@auxodata.ae
CONTACT_EMAIL=hello@auxodata.ae

# Site URL
PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://auxodata.ae
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Never commit `.env` to Git! It's already in `.gitignore`.

#### Step 2: Add Environment Variables to GitHub (for production)

Since your site deploys from GitHub, you need to add these to GitHub Secrets:

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** ‚Üí **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
3. Click **"New repository secret"**
4. Add these three secrets:

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `SENDGRID_API_KEY` | Your SendGrid API key (starts with SG.) |
| `SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL` | `noreply@auxodata.ae` |
| `CONTACT_EMAIL` | `hello@auxodata.ae` |

#### Step 3: Update GitHub Actions Workflow

Your deployment workflow needs to pass these environment variables.

Edit `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
# Add this under the build step
- name: Build
  run: npm run build
  env:
    SENDGRID_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.SENDGRID_API_KEY }}
    SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.SENDGRID_FROM_EMAIL }}
    CONTACT_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.CONTACT_EMAIL }}
    PUBLIC_SITE_URL: https://auxodata.ae
```

---

### **Phase 3: Testing (5 minutes)**

#### Local Testing

1. Make sure you have the `.env` file created
2. Run your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Go to your contact page
4. Fill out and submit the form
5. Check your terminal for any errors
6. Check your email inbox (hello@auxodata.ae)

#### Production Testing

After deploying:
1. Visit your live website
2. Submit a test contact form
3. You should receive:
   - Email notification to `hello@auxodata.ae`
   - Confirmation email sent to the user

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Problem: Emails going to spam

**Solution:**
1. Make sure domain authentication is complete (green checkmark in SendGrid)
2. Wait 24-48 hours after adding DNS records
3. Ask recipients to whitelist `noreply@auxodata.ae`
4. Check SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records are correct

### Problem: "SendGrid API key not configured" error

**Solution:**
1. Check `.env` file exists in project root
2. Verify the API key is correct (starts with `SG.`)
3. Make sure the API key has "Mail Send" permissions
4. For production, verify GitHub Secrets are set correctly

### Problem: Emails not sending

**Solution:**
1. Check SendGrid dashboard ‚Üí **Activity** to see delivery status
2. Look for error messages in server logs
3. Verify the FROM email (`noreply@auxodata.ae`) is verified in SendGrid
4. Check SendGrid account isn't suspended (free accounts have daily limits)

### Problem: DNS verification failing

**Solution:**
1. Use https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx to check if CNAME records exist
2. Enter: `s1._domainkey.auxodata.ae` and check for the CNAME
3. If not found, re-add DNS records and wait longer
4. Some registrars take 24-48 hours to propagate

## üìä Monitoring & Limits

### SendGrid Free Plan Limits
- **100 emails per day** (resets at midnight UTC)
- **2,000 contacts**
- Email support (no phone support)

This is more than enough for a contact form. If you exceed:
- Emails queue and send the next day
- Or upgrade to paid plan ($19.95/month for 40,000 emails)

### Check Email Statistics
1. Go to SendGrid dashboard ‚Üí **Activity**
2. See all sent emails, delivery status, opens, clicks
3. Check for bounces or spam reports

---

## üöÄ Alternative: Simple Email Service (if SendGrid doesn't work)

If you have issues with SendGrid, here's a simpler alternative using Google Apps Script:

### Quick Alternative Setup (10 minutes)

1. Go to https://script.google.com
2. Create a new project
3. Paste this code:

```javascript
function doPost(e) {
  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(e.postData.contents);

    MailApp.sendEmail({
      to: "hello@auxodata.ae",
      subject: "New Contact Form: " + data.name,
      body: `Name: ${data.name}\nEmail: ${data.email}\nCompany: ${data.company}\n\nMessage:\n${data.message}`
    });

    return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({success: true}))
      .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
  } catch (error) {
    return ContentService.createTextOutput(JSON.stringify({success: false}))
      .setMimeType(ContentService.MimeType.JSON);
  }
}
```

4. Deploy as web app (Anyone can access)
5. Copy the web app URL
6. Update your contact form to POST to this URL

**Limitations:**
- Only 100 emails per day
- Less reliable than SendGrid
- No email templates
- Requires Google account access
