---

## üìã Step-by-Step Setup

### **Phase 1: Brevo Account Setup (15 minutes)**

#### Step 1: Create Brevo Account

1. Go to https://www.brevo.com/
2. Click **Sign Up Free**
3. Sign up using your Google Workspace email (`yourname@auxodata.ae`)
4. Verify your email address
5. Complete the account setup wizard
6. Choose the **Free plan** (300 emails/day forever)

#### Step 2: Domain Authentication (IMPORTANT!)

This step is crucial for deliverability (avoiding spam folder).

1. In Brevo dashboard, go to **Senders, Domains & Dedicated IPs** (in Settings menu)
2. Click on the **Domains** tab
3. Click **Authenticate a new domain**
4. Enter your domain: `auxodata.ae`
5. Click **Authenticate**

6. Brevo will provide you with DNS records like this:

```
Type: TXT
Host: @ (or leave empty, or auxodata.ae)
Value: v=spf1 include:spf.brevo.com ~all

Type: TXT
Host: mail._domainkey
Value: v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=MIGfMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQC...

Type: CNAME
Host: brevo._domainkey
Value: brevo._domainkey.brevo.com
```

**Note:** The exact records will be provided by Brevo and may vary. Copy them exactly as shown.

#### Step 3: Add DNS Records to Your Domain

**Option A: If you manage DNS in Google Domains**
1. Go to https://domains.google.com
2. Select `auxodata.ae`
3. Go to **DNS** tab
4. Click **Manage custom records**
5. Add each TXT and CNAME record provided by Brevo
6. Click **Save**
7. Wait 24-48 hours (usually propagates in 1-2 hours)

**Option B: If you manage DNS elsewhere (GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.)**
1. Log into your domain registrar
2. Find DNS management section
3. Add the TXT and CNAME records provided by Brevo
4. Save changes
5. Wait for DNS propagation

**DNS Record Tips:**
- For TXT records with Host `@`, some registrars require you to leave the field empty or enter your domain name
- Make sure to copy the entire TXT value (they can be very long)
- Some registrars automatically add the domain to the Host field, so `mail._domainkey` might become `mail._domainkey.auxodata.ae`

#### Step 4: Verify Domain in Brevo

1. After adding DNS records, wait a few hours (minimum 1-2 hours)
2. Go back to Brevo ‚Üí **Settings** ‚Üí **Senders, Domains & Dedicated IPs** ‚Üí **Domains**
3. Click **Verify** next to `auxodata.ae`
4. If successful, you'll see a green checkmark ‚úÖ with status "Authenticated"
5. If verification fails, double-check your DNS records using [MXToolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx)

**Common DNS Verification Issues:**
- DNS records not propagated yet (wait 24-48 hours)
- Missing the `v=spf1` prefix in SPF record
- DKIM record truncated or split incorrectly
- Host field formatted wrong (@ vs empty vs domain name)

#### Step 5: Add Sender Email

1. In Brevo, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Senders, Domains & Dedicated IPs** ‚Üí **Senders**
2. Click **Add a Sender**
3. Enter:
   - **Email**: `noreply@auxodata.ae`
   - **Name**: `AUXO Data Labs`
4. Brevo will send a verification email to `noreply@auxodata.ae`
5. Check your Google Workspace inbox for `noreply@auxodata.ae`
6. Click the verification link in the email
7. Once verified, you'll see ‚úÖ next to the sender

**Important:** You must verify this sender email before you can send emails from it!

#### Step 6: Create API Key

1. In Brevo dashboard, go to **Settings** ‚Üí **SMTP & API**
2. Click the **API Keys** tab
3. Click **Generate a new API Key**
4. Settings:
   - **API Key Name**: `AUXO Website Contact Form`
   - Leave all permissions at default (or select just "Send transactional emails")
5. Click **Generate**
6. **COPY THE API KEY NOW** (you'll only see it once!)

It will look like: `xkeysib-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`

**‚ö†Ô∏è Security Warning:** Never commit this API key to Git or share it publicly!

---

### **Phase 2: Configure Your Website (10 minutes)**

#### Step 1: Create Environment File

1. In your website project folder (`A:\AUXO\Main Website`), create a file named `.env`
2. Add these lines (replace the API key with your actual one):

```bash
# Brevo Configuration
BREVO_API_KEY=xkeysib-your-actual-api-key-here
BREVO_FROM_EMAIL=noreply@auxodata.ae
BREVO_FROM_NAME=AUXO Data Labs
CONTACT_EMAIL=hello@auxodata.ae

# Site URL
PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://auxodata.ae
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Never commit `.env` to Git! It's already in `.gitignore`.

**Explanation of each variable:**
- `BREVO_API_KEY`: Your API key from Brevo (starts with `xkeysib-`)
- `BREVO_FROM_EMAIL`: The verified sender email (must match what you verified in Brevo)
- `BREVO_FROM_NAME`: Display name that appears in recipient's inbox
- `CONTACT_EMAIL`: Where you want to receive contact form notifications
- `PUBLIC_SITE_URL`: Your website URL (used in email links)

#### Step 2: Add Environment Variables to GitHub (for production)

Since your site deploys from GitHub Actions, you need to add these as GitHub Secrets:

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/yourusername/auxo-website
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. In the left sidebar, click **Secrets and variables** ‚Üí **Actions**
4. Click **New repository secret** button

Add these **4 secrets** one by one:

| Secret Name | Value | Example |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| `BREVO_API_KEY` | Your Brevo API key | `xkeysib-abc123...` |
| `BREVO_FROM_EMAIL` | Verified sender email | `noreply@auxodata.ae` |
| `BREVO_FROM_NAME` | Sender display name | `AUXO Data Labs` |
| `CONTACT_EMAIL` | Your business email | `hello@auxodata.ae` |

**How to add a secret:**
1. Click **New repository secret**
2. Enter the **Name** exactly as shown above (case-sensitive)
3. Paste the **Value**
4. Click **Add secret**
5. Repeat for all 4 secrets

#### Step 3: Update GitHub Actions Workflow

Your deployment workflow needs to pass these environment variables during the build.

1. Open `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
2. Find the build step (should look like `- name: Build`)
3. Add the `env:` section with all variables:

```yaml
- name: Build
  run: npm run build
  env:
    BREVO_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.BREVO_API_KEY }}
    BREVO_FROM_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.BREVO_FROM_EMAIL }}
    BREVO_FROM_NAME: ${{ secrets.BREVO_FROM_NAME }}
    CONTACT_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.CONTACT_EMAIL }}
    PUBLIC_SITE_URL: https://auxodata.ae
```

**Complete example:**
```yaml
- name: Install Dependencies
  run: npm ci

- name: Build
  run: npm run build
  env:
    BREVO_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.BREVO_API_KEY }}
    BREVO_FROM_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.BREVO_FROM_EMAIL }}
    BREVO_FROM_NAME: ${{ secrets.BREVO_FROM_NAME }}
    CONTACT_EMAIL: ${{ secrets.CONTACT_EMAIL }}
    PUBLIC_SITE_URL: https://auxodata.ae

- name: Deploy
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
  # ... rest of deploy config
```

4. Save the file
5. Commit and push to GitHub
6. GitHub Actions will use these secrets during deployment

---

### **Phase 3: Testing (5 minutes)**

#### Local Testing

1. Make sure you created the `.env` file with your actual Brevo API key
2. Start your development server:
   ```bash

   - Maintain good engagement (low bounce rate)
   - Don't send to invalid emails

### Problem: "Brevo API key not configured" error

**Symptoms:**
- Form submits but emails don't send
- Console shows: `Brevo API key not configured`

**Solutions:**
1. Check `.env` file exists in project root
   ```bash
   # Navigate to project folder
   cd "A:\AUXO\Main Website"

   # Check if .env exists
   dir .env
   ```

2. Verify `.env` has the correct key format:
   ```bash
   BREVO_API_KEY=xkeysib-xxxxx...
   ```
   - Must start with `xkeysib-`
   - No quotes around the value
   - No spaces before or after `=`

3. Restart development server after creating/editing `.env`:
   ```bash
   # Stop server (Ctrl+C)
   # Then restart
   npm run dev
   ```

4. For production, verify GitHub Secrets:
   - Go to GitHub repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Verify `BREVO_API_KEY` exists
   - Re-add if necessary (secrets can't be viewed, only replaced)

5. Check API key permissions in Brevo:
   - Go to Brevo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí SMTP & API ‚Üí API Keys
   - Verify the key has "Send transactional emails" permission

### Problem: Emails not sending at all

**Symptoms:**
- Form submission succeeds
- But no emails received (not even in spam)
- Brevo dashboard shows no activity

**Solutions:**
1. **Check Brevo dashboard for errors:**
   - Go to Brevo ‚Üí **Statistics** ‚Üí **Transactional**
   - Look for recent sends
   - Check delivery status (Delivered, Bounced, Blocked)
   - Click on a message to see error details

2. **Verify sender email is verified:**
   - Go to Brevo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Senders
   - `noreply@auxodata.ae` must have ‚úÖ status
   - If not, verify the email again

3. **Check domain authentication:**
   - Go to Brevo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
   - `auxodata.ae` must show "Authenticated" status
   - If not, re-verify DNS records

4. **Look for error messages in server logs:**
   - Check browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
   - Check terminal where dev server is running
   - Look for Brevo API errors

5. **Verify API key is active:**
   - Go to Brevo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí SMTP & API ‚Üí API Keys
   - Check the key hasn't been deleted or deactivated
   - Generate a new one if needed

6. **Check account status:**
   - Ensure Brevo account isn't suspended
   - Verify you haven't exceeded 300 emails/day limit
   - Check for any billing issues (shouldn't be any on free plan)

7. **Test with a minimal example:**
   ```bash
   # Create a test file: test-brevo.js
   # Then run: node test-brevo.js
   ```
   See if direct API calls work (rules out website code issues)

### Problem: DNS verification failing

**Symptoms:**
- Added DNS records hours/days ago
- Brevo still shows "Not verified" or "Verification pending"
- Can't send emails from domain

**Solutions:**
1. **Wait longer:**
   - DNS propagation can take 24-48 hours
   - Some registrars are slower than others
   - Try again tomorrow

2. **Verify DNS records using MXToolbox:**
   - Go to https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx
   - Check SPF: Enter `auxodata.ae` and select "SPF Record Lookup"
     - Should show: `v=spf1 include:spf.brevo.com ~all`
   - Check DKIM: Enter `mail._domainkey.auxodata.ae` and select "TXT Lookup"
     - Should show the DKIM public key
   - If not found, DNS records aren't propagated yet

3. **Check DNS record format:**
   - Make sure you copied the entire value (DKIM keys are very long)
   - Check for extra spaces or line breaks
   - Verify Host field is correct:
     - Some registrars need `mail._domainkey`
     - Others need `mail._domainkey.auxodata.ae`
     - Try both if unsure

4. **Re-add DNS records:**
   - Delete existing records
   - Wait 1 hour
   - Add them again with exact values from Brevo
   - Save changes

5. **Contact your DNS provider:**
   - Some registrars have issues with long TXT records
   - May need to split DKIM record or use special format
   - Support can help verify records are correct

6. **Use Brevo's DNS checker:**
   - In domain authentication, Brevo shows which records are missing
   - Focus on fixing those specific records first

7. **Flush DNS cache (on your computer):**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   ipconfig /flushdns

   # Mac
   sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder

   # Linux
   sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
   ```

### Problem: Form submission fails with error

**Symptoms:**
- User clicks submit
- Form shows error message
- Nothing sent to API

**Solutions:**
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12 ‚Üí Console)
2. Verify form validation rules are met:
   - Name: required, 2-100 characters
   - Email: valid format
   - Company: optional, max 100 characters
   - Message: required, 10-2000 characters
3. Check network tab (F12 ‚Üí Network) for failed API requests
4. Ensure rate limiting isn't blocking (max 5 requests per 15 min per IP)
5. Verify honeypot field (`website`) is empty (bot detection)

### Problem: Wrong email templates or formatting

**Symptoms:**
- Emails sent successfully
- But content looks wrong or broken

**Solutions:**
1. Check HTML renders correctly:
   - Send test email to yourself
   - View in multiple email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail)
   - Check mobile and desktop views

2. Verify environment variables are correct:
   - `BREVO_FROM_NAME`: Should be "AUXO Data Labs"
   - `CONTACT_EMAIL`: Should be `hello@auxodata.ae`
   - Check for typos

3. Test plain text fallback:
   - Some email clients don't support HTML
   - Plain text version should be readable

4. Update templates in code:
   - Edit `src/pages/api/contact.ts`
   - Modify `htmlContent` and `textContent` properties
   - Redeploy website
